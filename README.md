Multi class brain diseases detection

Introduction

Brain disorders can lead to the loss of critical functions such as thinking, speech, and movement. 
The common method used to diagnose these disorders is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, manual 
diagnosis of brain abnormalities is time-consuming and challenging, especially in the early stages of abnormalities. 
This repository aims to address these challenges by utilizing deep learning models for accurate classification of 
multiple brain diseases, including Alzheimer's, degenerative, neoplastic, and more.

Objective

The objective of this research project is to develop an Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that 
can effectively classify MRI images of various brain disorders. Unlike previous studies that focused on a single disease,
our approach considers multiple brain diseases to provide a comprehensive diagnostic solution. We compare the effectiveness 
of popular deep learning models, namely AlexNet, VGG-16, and ResNet-50, in achieving accurate classification results.

Repository Contents
